You play as a character who has been given a chance to redo one day. It won't change the past. But you'll know whether there was something you could done differently, or not.

	
The typical visual novel or story-based game has paths & replayability, but you hav	to restart each time from scratch. This game is meant to have the player go through all 'paths' on each playthrough with a main character that knows that there are paths and choices to be made.
