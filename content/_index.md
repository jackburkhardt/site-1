Hi, I'm Erin, an undergrad at Northwestern University working on getting a BS in Computer Science. My interests mainly lie in user-centered creation, such as UI/UX and game design. 

I am currently working on:
* [Ari](/ari): A visual novel about regret and acceptance.
* [Ghost City](/ghostcity): A 2D sidescrolling platformer of a detective in a city of ghosts.
