Hi, I'm Erin, an undergrad at Northwestern University working on getting a BS in Computer Science. My interests mainly lie in user-centered creation, such as UI/UX and game design. 

I mostly do programming, some mechanical engineering, and art. When it comes to languages, I have experience in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++ and Racket. Engineering is pretty cool as well. I'm involved with Northwestern Formula Racing  & have done some interesting Northwestern-sanctioned projects, such as a chemistry-inspired educational [RPG game](/projects/chemquest).

I have 7 years of traditional art experience. I mostly favored the mediums of colored pencils, oil paints, and graphite, though I did do a bit of experimentation with various other mediums. I also do digital & pixel art, which you can see [here](/projects/art).

I am currently working on:
* [Ari](/projects/ari): A visual novel about regret and acceptance.
* [Ghost City](/projects/ghostcity): A 2D sidescrolling platformer of a detective in a city of ghosts.
